# AI Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project aims to develop an AI-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect malicious activity within a network. The system will analyze network traffic and raise alerts for suspicious activities, acting as a defense mechanism to protect against cyber threats. This system uses machine learning algorithms for real-time intrusion detection.

## Features
- Real-time threat detection
- Alert system for malicious activity
- AI-based decision-making
- Logs for further analysis
